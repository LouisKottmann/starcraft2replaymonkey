## Important infos

This file has moved from [google code](https://code.google.com/p/starcraft2replaymonkey/)

Sc2ParserApe is a tool I made to parse SC2's replays from C#, 
it is probably way out of date in regard to the current state of replay files but could be updated.

TheOmniscientChimp still relies on files on the google code page to update this software.

## Technical information

This project uses SC2ParserApe available [here](http://code.google.com/p/sc2parserape/) (bundled in, you don't need to install it separately)

Phalanger is no longer required to be installed for this software to run, but you can still have an interested look 
[here](http://phalanger.codeplex.com/) =)

However, you DO need the Framework .Net 4.0 available 
[here](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9cfb2d51-5ff4-4491-b0e5-b386f32c0992&displaylang=en), 
and VC++ 2010 SP runtime available 
[here](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=a7b7a05e-6de6-4d3a-a423-37bf0912db84)

These two things are very common, and you should already have them installed unless you're running a fresh windows.

It has no intention to display exhaustive information on the game, 
its main purpose is to help the user sort his replays and quickly decide which ones he wants to watch.

*Run TheOmniscientChimp.exe to ensure always having the latest version running*

## Features

    - Displays all the basic information (realm, players names, races, APM ...).
    - Allow for easy relocation (to your starcraft II replay folder for example).
    - Displays APM graph. (New in v0.0.0.4b)
    - Diplays player's builds (next to their APM graphs). (New in v1.0.1 !)

    - A big renaming ability has been added, with lots of possibilities (New in v1.1.0!)
    - An auto-updater/loader will automatically notify you of new versions if you run *TheOmniscientChimp.exe* instead of Sc2ReplayMonkey.exe, the former will also automatically start the latter once the update is done (if there is one). (New in v1.1.0!)
    - You can chose between two skins (Zerg and Terran) *(New in v1.2.0!)*
